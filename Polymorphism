What is Polymorphism in Python?
     The literal meaning of Polymorphism is - having different forms.
     In programming, Polymorphism refers to a function having the same name but being used in different ways and different scenarios. 
Real time example of polymorphism :
     Another excellent real time example of polymorphism is your smartphone. 
     The smartphone can act as phone, camera, music player and what not, taking different forms and hence polymorphism.
     Behaviour of humans can also be considered real time example of polymorphism.
     Like a person behaves differently with different person
Advantages of Polymorphism:
     1.Programmers code can be reused via Polymorphism.
     2.Supports a single variable name for multiple data types.
     3.Reduces coupling between different functionalities.
Disadvantages of Polymorphism:
     1.Polymorphism ends up raising performance issues in real-time.
     2.Polymorphism reduces the readability of the code.
     3.Programmers find Polymorphism a little challenging to implement.
