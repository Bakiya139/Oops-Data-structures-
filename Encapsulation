what is Encapsulation :
     Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
     In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class
Types of Encapsulation in OOPs:

1. Data Member Encapsulation

     Data members can be defined as Private members of the Class. Setters and Getters methods should be used by any object that wants to change or retrieve the value of a data member.

2. Method Encapsulation

     We can hide methods used for internal implementation that does not need to be visible to the public. The method should be declared as private so that the user does not have access to it.

3. Class Encapsulation

     Our implementation might contain an internal implementation of a class that stores and processes specific information.
     We encapsulate that class by defining it as private and hiding it from user access. 
     These classes should not be included in any public interface.
     
Real-Life Example of Encapsulation:
     Let's look at a real-life example to better comprehend the notion of encapsulation.
     Consider a Capsule as an example (Medicine). 
     The capsule's powder is made up of many components, and the capsule's outer shield protects the internal components from the outside world. 
     Similarly, we can wrap data and code as a single unit and secure it from outside code using Encapsulation.
