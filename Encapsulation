what is Encapsulation :
     Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
     In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class
Types of Encapsulation in OOPs:
Real-Life Example of Encapsulation:
     Let's look at a real-life example to better comprehend the notion of encapsulation.
     Consider a Capsule as an example (Medicine). 
     The capsule's powder is made up of many components, and the capsule's outer shield protects the internal components from the outside world. 
     Similarly, we can wrap data and code as a single unit and secure it from outside code using Encapsulation.
